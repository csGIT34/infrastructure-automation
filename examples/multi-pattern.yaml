# Multi-Pattern Infrastructure Request Example
#
# This file demonstrates how to provision multiple patterns in a single request
# using YAML multi-document format (documents separated by ---).
#
# Key features:
# - Use 'action: create' (default) to provision new resources
# - Use 'action: destroy' to tear down existing resources
# - Destroy actions are executed FIRST, then create actions
# - Each document is processed sequentially
# - Partial failures are reported (remaining patterns still process)
#
# Use case: Replacing an old database with a new one
# 1. Destroy the old PostgreSQL database
# 2. Create a new Key Vault for secrets
# 3. Create a new storage account for data
